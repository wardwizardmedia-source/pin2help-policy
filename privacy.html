    <h1>Privacy Policy for Pin2Help</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> [Date of Publish]</p>

    <p>This privacy policy governs your use of the software application Pin2Help ("Application") for mobile devices that was created by Wardwizard Media. The Application is intended to help users report animals in need, and to connect volunteers and donors to help these animals.</p>

    <h2>What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?</h2>
    
    <h3>User Provided Information</h3>
    <p>The Application obtains the information you provide when you download and register the Application. Registration with us is optional. However, please keep in mind that you may not be able to use some of the features offered by the Application unless you register with us.</p>
    <p>When you register with us and use the Application, you generally provide (a) your name, email address, and other registration information; (b) information you provide us when you contact us for help.</p>

    <h3>Information Collected Automatically</h3>
    <p>In addition, the Application may collect certain information automatically, including, but not limited to, the user's location for the purpose of placing pins on the map. This location data is essential for the core functionality of the app.</p>

    <h2>Does the Application collect precise real-time location information of the device?</h2>
    <p>Yes. When you use the Application to report an animal, we will use GPS technology (or other similar technology) to determine your current location in order to display a location pin on a map. This information is shared with other users of the app to allow them to find and help the animal in need.</p>

    <h2>Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the Application?</h2>
    <p>Yes. We will share your information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.</p>
    <p>We may disclose User Provided and Automatically Collected Information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process;</li>
        <li>with our trusted services providers who work on our behalf, do not have an independent use of the information we disclose to them, and have agreed to adhere to the rules set forth in this privacy statement (e.g. Firebase, Google Maps).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Retention Policy, Managing Your Information</h2>
    <p>We will retain User Provided data for as long as you use the Application and for a reasonable time thereafter. If you'd like us to delete User Provided Data that you have provided via the Application, please contact us at pin2helps@gmail.com and we will respond in a reasonable time.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. We provide physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information we process and maintain. For example, we limit access to this information to authorized employees and contractors who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our Application.</p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy here. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.</p>
